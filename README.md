4) Download and install GitHub Desktop [LINK](https://desktop.github.com/)
5) Sign into GitHub Desktop with GitHub Account
6) Create a local copy of the Repository opeing 'File -> Clone repository -> URL'

### When editing files
Since files are stored as binary (unreadable to humans) it is important that no two file have a merge conflict. This can be done by "locking" a file when we edit it which prevents others from making changes to it at the same time.

To Lock a file, right click in the folder the file is in and select "Git bash here". Then enter the command:
`git lfs lock FILENAME.Ext`
To Unlock a file use the command:
`git lfs unlock FILENAME.Ext`
The command `ls` will list all the files in the current folder if you don't know the extension. To see all the files that are currently locked, `git lfs locks` will list who has locked what.

To sumarize the editing process:
1) Pull the current files from the server
2) Lock the file using `git lfs lock FILENAME`
3) Edit the file
4) Add changes to the commits `git add FILENAME` or `git add --all`
5) Commit the edits with a description using GitHub Desktop with `git commit -m 'MESSAGE GOES HERE'`
6) `git pull` and `git push` the new commits to the server (Contact Neko'z or Galbatorix if you get an error!)
7) Unlock the file using `git lfs unlock FILENAME`
